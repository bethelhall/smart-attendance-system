# facenet-face-recognition

This repository contains an implementation of the FaceNet network (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03832.pdf) to determine whether or not a webcam frame contains a recognized individual. 
The repository also has a C# implementation of a desktop application where users register their attendance using a webcam.
